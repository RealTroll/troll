Welcome to Troll! This little joke program is intended to TROLL people! 

# HOW TO INSTALL:

Just click on "Troll" in the releases section on the right.
After you installed the .zip file extract it anywhere you can access it easily and enter the password "trolled".

# HOW TO USE:

Open Troll.exe. If it gives you an error, disable any antivirus softwares. Also if it says its a PUP or any other type of virus it's a false positive.
If you want to exit the fake BSOD screen, press F7. If F7 doesn't work, you need to figure out how to exit this yourself!
